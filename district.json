These three students are Gunand Thind, from North High School; Ashley-Ann Francis, from South High School; and Mary Youssef, from Central High School.</p>\n<p>The new liaisons were selected by their senior high school building principals, and their nominations mark a shift from the previous VSCHSD Board policy of selecting a single student liaison on a yearly rotating basis from each school to serve on the Board. For this year and going forward, a student representative from each senior high school will sit on the Board simultaneously, and relay concerns and requests from their respective student bodies as the Board works to develop District policy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gunand Thind – North High School</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“Gunand is an exceptional young lady whose intellectual creativity and motivation sets her apart as a truly remarkable scholar and individual,” said North Principal Dr. Robin Small. “Academically, Gunand shines in her diligence, commitment, and tenacity, and beyond academics she is distinguished by her character and leadership qualities. Respected by faculty and students, she combines warmth and confidence with a readiness to participate and voice her opinions.” Gunand is currently president of North’s ecology club and National Honor Society; she is a member of the grade council, senior high school student council, and is a member of the Mathletes and student peer organization. “Her dedication has earned her induction into multiple honor societies, including language, math, science, social studies, and English,” Dr. Small added. “I am confident Gunand will be an incredible asset as North’s student liaison.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mary Youssef – Central High School</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“I am honored to introduce Mary Youssef as the student representative from Central,” said Central Principal Candace Hugee. Mary is in the top 1 percent of her class and has taken numerous Advanced Placement classes including AP Statistics, AP Calculus BC, AP English Literature, AP Government and Politics, AP French Language and Culture, and AP Psychology. This fall, she was recommended as an AP Scholar with Distinction and received an AP Capstone diploma. She is the current president of the student council, president of the History Honor Society, and is a member of the Key Club, library squad, and is the treasurer of the National Honor Society. She is also member of the math, science, and English honor societies. Additionally, Mary has taken part in the Districtwide music festival for the past two years. Mary looks to follow in her father’s footsteps to study medicine and become a surgeon. “Central is so proud of Mary, and I have no doubt she will serve the Board of Education well as our student liaison,” said Ms. Hugee.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ashley-Ann Francis – South High School</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“Ashley-Ann is an extremely accomplished individual who has shown an incredible amount of dedication to both her studies and her community,” said South Principal Matthew Swinson. She is a 16-year-old senior at South, and is currently in the top 2 percent of her graduating class with a GPA of 103.97. Ashley-Ann has been awarded an AP Seminar in Research certification as well as an AP Scholar with Distinction award from College Board. At age 16, Ashley-Ann conducted three separate research studies and earned AP Capstone in Independent Research recognition and has had her work published in a science journal and exhibited at various fairs and symposiums. She is the secretary of the National Honor Society and the treasurer of the Ro Kappa National Social Studies Honor Society. Ashley-Ann also helps oversee 11 Key Club chapters on Long Island as the secretary of the New York District Key Club Division 7. Additionally, she is the president of Youth Voices, a regional, student-led social justice organization that meets with local elected officials to discuss issues and advocate for students. Outside of extracurriculars, Ashley-Ann is also active in her church. “There are nearly too many accomplishments to list for Ashley-Ann, and as liaison I know she will continue her advocacy work for our students at South,” said Mr. Swinson.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_231423\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-231423\" class=\"size-large wp-image-231423\" src=\"https://vschsd.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Page-3-Student-Liasons-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://vschsd.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Page-3-Student-Liasons-980x551.jpg 980w, https://vschsd.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Page-3-Student-Liasons-480x270.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-231423\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Valley Stream Central High School District Board of Education with its new student liaisons, Gunand Thind, front row from left, Mary Youssef, and Ashley-Ann Francis.</p></div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Valley Stream Central High School District is proud to welcome its Board of Education student liaisons for the 2023-2024 school year.
